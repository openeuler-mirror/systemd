Subject: [PATCH] resolved: create /etc/resolv.conf symlink at runtime

If the symlink doesn't exists, and we are being started, let's
create it to provie name resolution.

If it exists, do nothing. In particular, if it is a broken symlink,
we cannot really know if the administator configured it to point to
a location used by some service that hasn't started yet, so we
don't touch it in that case either.
